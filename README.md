We just built a simple clock-in and clock-out system for our grocery. And we are testing many functions based on many actual situations.

Let us explore this simple system, and we will talk about tech stacks.

Firstly, we still use tkinter as our desktop platform, which has less code to realize functions. Second, we will use the default camera of laptop(many desktops need to set up an extra camera) to realize the core function of the clock-in and clock-out system. 

We need to run these commands on our terminal.

```
pip install opencv-python
```

```
pip install ttkbootstrap
```
